# For The Coaches

## A proactive coach:
- expects silences
- understands the silences will get awkward
- encourages sharing
- "Oh are you up to Step x? Share your progress with us!"
- Attendees can screenshare their progress, voice chat, or text chat
- Lean on your partner coach to banter, chat about the activity or encourage open conversation!
- People are here to learn, but it's also a nice break away from work for many

## Icebreaker
- Franca has outlined the icebreaker for everyone
- Useful to delegate facilitator/support roles (who will talk and when) ahead of time with your paired up coach

## Using Discord

### Voice and Text Channels
- Discord supports voice and text channels separately

- Clicking on a voice channel will enter you into that channel automatically, so be careful!

![Joining a voice channel example](https://github.com/nekosoft/just-discord-things/blob/instructions/discord%20gifs/channel_categories.gif)

- There is a voice channel, which will be named the same as a second channel which will be text only
- While in a voice channel, you can click on any other text channel and type in it

### Creating a channel

### Moving People Around Channels
You can move people in and out of channels, including yourself.
- Useful when wanting to do a 1-on-1 with someone in a different channel
- If someone joins the wrong channel

*Note: it's a bit weird and makes someone feel like they're not in control, so get their permission and let them know you're about to move them*

### Muting People
Sometimes people will accidentally leave their mics on, which can get noisy if someone is trying to speak. If someone's voice is coming through, they will have a green highlight around their avatar

1. Right click their name
2. Click the "Mute" checkbox to check it __not Server Mute__
3. Repeat above to unmute

People can unmute themselves too by repeating the steps above, or using User Control (see User Control).

### Deafen
Not inclusive language, this has been chosen by Discord.
This option means that the person "Deafened" will not be able to hear anybody. I don't see any reason to use this for our workshop.

### User Control and Disconnecting From Voice
(I made up the name User Control)
In the bottom left corner, there is an overview of:
- your username
- if you are on mute or deafened
- settings
- if you are connected to a voice server, and which one it is
- disconnect button

## Screen Sharing

### Starting Screen Share
User Control is also where you'll find the __Screen Share__ option. You have to be connected to a voice channel to be able to screen share. Anybody in that voice channel only can view your screen.

Starting screen share from User Control:
![Start Screen Share from User Control](https://github.com/nekosoft/just-discord-things/blob/instructions/discord%20gifs/user_control_start_screen_share_options.gif)

Screen Share Options:
__Screens__
This will share your entire Desktop screen (whichever you select, if you have more than 1 monitor). 
Be careful with this option, if you alt-tab, get notifications, etc, people can see *everything* on your screen.

__Applications Share__
This will share just the applicatioon window that you select. To avoid sharing everything on your desktop, you can choose just one specific (and only this) application. If this gets a bit tricky, the Screens option is simpler but has more risk. 

![Application screen sharing option](https://github.com/nekosoft/just-discord-things/blob/instructions/discord%20gifs/appplications_option.png)

### Disconnecting from Screen Share
There will be an option that shows up in the preview of your shared screen. It's a __desktop icon with an x in the middle.__ 

![Disconnect from screen share](https://github.com/nekosoft/just-discord-things/blob/instructions/discord%20gifs/stop_streaming.png)

__If you get overwhelmed, disconnecting from the voice channel and reconnecting is an alternate way to stop a screen share.__

## Three Types of Questions and How To Handle Them (by JC)

First ask - "What is the output? Read/copy and paste it to me." (might be in terminal, an error dialog box...)

__1. What does *this* mean?__
How to handle it:
- use a whiteboarding tool
- if you have access to Miro, this works
- draw.io(https://app.diagrams.net/) is okay for diagrams
- any other browser drawing application can work

__If you're not sure of the answer, be honest and then ask one of the specialists.__

*This is not a drawing tool, but it's fun. [Check it out.](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/)*


__2. Minikube did something weird__
- Output is weird: ask them to copy and paste out their output
- Keels over: ask them to show you their screen (screen share or screenshot, paste image in channel)
