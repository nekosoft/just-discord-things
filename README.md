# For The Coaches

## A proactive coach:
- expects silences
- understands the silences will get awkward
- encourages sharing
- "Oh are you up to Step x? Share your progress with us!"
- Attendees can screenshare their progress, voice chat, or text chat
- Lean on your partner coach to banter, chat about the activity or encourage open conversation!
- People are here to learn, but it's also a nice break away from work for many

## Icebreaker
- Franca has outlined the icebreaker for everyone
- Useful to delegate facilitator/support roles (who will talk and when) ahead of time with your paired up coach

## Using Discord

__Voice and Text Channels__
- Discord supports voice and text channels separately

- Clicking on a voice channel will enter you into that channel
![Joining a voice channel example](https://github.com/nekosoft/just-discord-things/blob/instructions/discord%20gifs/channel_categories.gif)

- There is a voice channel, which will be named the same as a second channel which will be text only
- While in a voice channel, you can click on any other text channel and type in it
